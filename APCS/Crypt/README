TESTING: How long does it take to encrypt and decrypt?
The run time (nanoseconds): 890105420
Formatted as (minutes:seconds:milliseconds:nanoseconds): 0:00:890:105420

TESTING: Is your unencrypted file exactly equal to the original?
Is the file the same after an encrypt, then a decrypt? true

TESTING: Is your encrypted file exactly equal to the algorithm sample?
Does the encrypted file match the sample? true
